            Your playgroup is worried about you.  Your play patterns are self destructive and it's starting to affect everyone around you.
            <br>
            They just want to help you find a strategy that doesn't suck the fun out of the game.

            Here, they made a list of things you could do if you stopped playing Azorius control:

                It's a beautiful day out.  Have you thought of going outside?  You should go outside.  You don't even have to go for a walk or anything.  Just enjoy the cool air.
            </div>
            <div>
                Nice, isn't it?  Just close your eyes and breath in and out and in and out and keep doing that as my voice slowly fades away...
            </div>

        <section class="hide" id="friendsSection">
            <div>
                Just imagine how much time you'll have to socialize if you aren't playing such long games.  You could find people that share your interests.  Like the neighborhood watch.  Or maybe the HOA.
                <br>
                ...
                <br>
                No, I mean real friends.  
                <br>
                ...
                <br>
                Do you really think the people you're playing with want to hear your story about bullying the twelve year old with the aggro deck again?

                Oh, <a href="https://www.oremrecreation.com">look</a>! Orem has a recreation center.  Water is kind of like blue mana.  Would you like to go to the pool?

                Imagine this: your opponent casts their favorite card.  You can see the joy it brings them.  And you let it happen.  You don't have to say "no" to fun before it even hits the table.  You untap and pay six for Colossal Dreadmaw.  You're playing Magic as Richard Garfield intended.  You're <strong>free</strong>.
